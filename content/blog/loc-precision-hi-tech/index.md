### The Motor Mount

The Hi-Tech doesn't come with motor retention, so let's add some! I went with an Aero Pack retaining ring which has a
ring that attaches to the bottom of the included motor mount. A cap is then threaded over this once the motor has been
inserted to keep the motor from popping out on ejection.

The Aero Pack retainer's instructions suggest cleaning the grooved inside of the retaining ring (the part that slides
over the motor mount) with acetone, so do that first. Then rough up the motor mount tube with some sandpaper. This'll
help the epoxy bond stronger.

As you can see from the pic, I've also already epoxied one of the centering rings just below the retainer ring.

Once this is set, time to epoxy the other centering ring to the other end of the motor mount.

After both of these have had some time to dry, time to flip the motor mount and add epoxy to the other side of
the rings. We can also go ahead and put the eye bolt in and add a dab of epoxy to the threads to make sure it
stays secure.

Go ahead and attach the shock cord to the eye bolt using a quick link. Note this is different than the instructions
which have you epoxy a small piece of string inside the body tube for attaching the shock cord to. Attaching the shock
cord to the motor mount directly will give the recovery harness more strength and less likely to pull out at a critical
moment.

Now spread some epoxy around the body tube just past the fin slots. Make sure no epoxy
gets into the fin slots. Then thread the shock cord through the body tube and insert the motor mount. The stock
directions instruct you to place the rocket on its end, but we can't do that due to the motor retainer (it would push
the motor mount in too far, interferring with the fin slots). Instead lay the rocket on its side while the epoxy sets up.

Once the epoxy sets, stuff the shock cord into the upper part of the body and turn the motor mount up. Pour some epoxy
in the joint between the centering ring and body tube. Make sure to wipe off any epoxy that gets onto the motor retainer.
Leave the body tube standing upright while the epoxy finishes setting. Let this assembly dry overnight.
